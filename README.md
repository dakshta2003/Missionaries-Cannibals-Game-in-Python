# Missionaries-Cannibals-Game-in-Python
This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Missionaries &amp; Cannibals puzzle. The goal is to transport three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat while ensuring that missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side.
